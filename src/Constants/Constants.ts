	Nitrutsav works to give students a creative outlet to commemorate 
	and introspectively explore their creative freedom with pioneering 
	ideas, celebrating the creative goodwill of a mind filled with ingenuity 
	and innovation. With a plethora of fascinating cultural events, it also 
	provides students with a gateway to showcase their creative zeal and

	talents. With the hackneyed breakdown of academia and constant 
	improvisation of grades, NITRUTSAV delivers different experiences to 
	lure your mind to relaxation and enthusiasm.
	In the bizarre outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, Nitrusav was 
	hosted on your screens last year. The essence of Nitrusav is restored 
	to its complete form to captivate you through your eyes and into your 
	mind.This time with the theme of "An Indian Filmic Fete", this 
	impeccable beauty will mesmerise right through the windows of your 
	soul.`,
